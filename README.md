This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Commits

To make commit messages as clear as possible we use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to ensure [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) practice is followed

### After adding files to commit using `git add`

Instead of using

`git commit -m "commit message"`

Use

`
git commit
`

Which will run `cz`
